## About the project

In this project, I am implementing the game Boggle. The game consists of a 4x4 board of dice, each die having a letter on it. At the beginning of the game, a random board with letters is generated. There is only one player, and from the moment the game starts, the player has 3 minutes to score as many points as possible by finding valid words on the board.

A valid word is defined as a word that appears in the dictionary and is formed by a path on the game board that starts at one letter and moves to adjacent letters. An adjacent letter is considered to be a letter that is next to the current letter in any of the eight directions (up, down, right, left, or any of the four diagonals). It is allowed to use the same die for different words, but it is not allowed to use the same die twice for the same word.

Each word earns points equal to the square of the length of the path. Points cannot be earned for the same word more than once, even if it appears multiple times on the board.
